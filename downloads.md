### Downloading the OpenDA software

The official releases and some intermediate code snapshots of OpenDA can be downloaded from sourceforge (https://sourceforge.net/projects/openda). The binary distributions are the best starting point for new users.

The development version of OpenDA with all the latest functionality is hosted as a github repository at https://github.com/OpenDA-Association/OpenDA

If you want to contribute to OpenDA, more information can be found in the 'contributing.md' file in the root of the GitHub repository, or you can click [here](https://github.com/OpenDA-Association/OpenDA/blob/master/contributing.md).
