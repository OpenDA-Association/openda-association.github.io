title: Introduction to OpenDA
---
OpenDA is a generic environment for data-assimilation tasks like parameter calibration and measurement filtering. It provides a platform that allows an easy interchange of algorithms and models.

It is a modular framework, containing methods and tools that can be used for a wide range of applications. By offering the data-assimilation software as a separate component, the cost of applying data-assimilation methods in one's project is reduced. At the same time, it allows new developments in the field of data assimilation to quickly spread to all applications that might benefit from it.

Some theory that might be helpful to understand the basics behind OpenDA includes the distinction between offline and online methods, the statistical framework used, the notions of deterministic and stochastic models, and the general structure of filtering methods.
