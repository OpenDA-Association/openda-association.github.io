The OpenDA association is an open association of institutes and people involved in OpenDA. Its aim is to facilitate OpenDA and its community and to safeguard its well-being. The association maintains the website, receives donations (and uses them a.o. to improve the quality of the software and documentation), organises courses and user-meetings and generally promotes OpenDA. It should also take action if the community does not function as it should. That is, for example, if the community does not manage to create timely, stable releases. Note that the association as such is in prinicple not supposed to decide about the OpenDA functionality because, as an Open Source product, the community will eventually decide what is best for OpenDA.
Membership of the OpenDA association is open to any person or organisation that wants to take part in its activities and who has made a significant contribution to OpenDA in some form. By becoming a member of the association, you show that you have an active interest in OpenDA and are willing to serve its community. As a member, you pay a fee to help finance the association and you are supposed to participate in its activities. In return, you get a vote in guaranteeing that OpenDA will stay alive and kicking and you can present yourself under the Partners and Services section on the OpenDA website.
If you are an active OpenDA user or developer and want to become a member of the OpenDA association, please contact OpenDA at info@openda.org .

Running OpenDA projects
Even now, there are several groups that hold extensive OpenDA expertise. You can find a list of these in the Partners section. The very fact that they are listed on the OpenDA website means that they are interested in participating in OpenDA projects. So, if you are looking for partners to run your project, just contact the one that best seems to match your needs.
Become an OpenDA partner
If you are a heavy user of OpenDA, you may want to become an OpenDA partner. Becoming an OpenDA partner means that you join the OpenDA association. More information about the OpenDA association can be found here. As a member of the OpenDA association, you help to saveguard the well-being of OpenDA and it's community, thus saveguarding the OpenDA software that is important to you.

Partners
The Partner section has it's own role to play in the OpenDA community. By presenting the parties that are now involved in OpenDA, it helps interested parties to find the services and support they need. If you are considering the use of OpenDA, but would like to have support from experienced users, you can contact one of the parties mentioned in the Partner section and see if they can help you out. An overview of the partners is given here. Please note that the Partner section is intended as a service only; the OpenDA association does not accept liability for the services that are provided by a partner. Nevertheless, a consistently bad performance is likely to lead to discussions and consequent steps in the OpenDA association to which every partner belongs.
 
	
#### Delft University of Technology, Applied Mathematics Department

Mathematical physics is concerned with mathematical modeling of physical phenomena. Most often this leads to a mathematical model in terms of (partial) differential equations. In fact, differential equations present the main theme in our group and we employ both analytical and numerical solution methods. Simulation using computer implementations of models with a practical significance have a large impact on our research. A close collaboration exists with external partners, such as Shell, TNO, Rijkswaterstaat. A rather unique feature of our group is that we often consider large scale systems in relation with large scale computer models and that we address the specific mathematical questions arising from this. We mention data assimilation (coupling of model and measurements), flexible numerical methods (numerics for real-life applications), high-performance computing (enlargement of scale), multiple scale analysis and asymptotics (model simplification), and stochastic differential equations (dealing with uncertainties).
The Mathematical Physics Department was one of the originators of OpenDA and was home to the development of the computational core. Research into new data-assimilation methods and practical applications of data-assimilation is done on the basis of the OpenDA framework.

#### Deltares
Deltares is a Dutch independent research institute for water, soil and subsurface issues. We work on innovative solutions that make life in deltas, coastal areas and river basins safe, clean and sustainable. We conduct research and provide specialist advisory services for government authorities and the corporate sector in the Netherlands and globally. The essence of our work is the development, application and sharing of knowledge. We develop knowledge in partnerships with universities, other knowledge institutions and the business sector, not only in government research programmes but also in contract research. Deltares has more than 800 employees, and we are based in Delft and Utrec. Deltares has a rich experience in applying OpenDA for water management models, including calibration of wave models and Kalman filtering for operational storm surge models. Deltares is one of the originators of OpenDA.

#### VORtech
VORtech is a combination of a software house and an engineering firm in applied mathematics. We combine a thorough knowledge of mathematical modeling, simulation techniques and computational algorithms with state-of-the-art software development methods. VORtech specialises in high performance computing, data-assimilation and model coupling. VORtech has been actively involved in the development of OpenDA and has done several major projects involving the application of OpenDA. Among these was the IMPOSE project (together with BMT-ARGOSS and KNMI), in which we have developed a system to monitor the air quality over the North sea, using satellite observations in combination with the Chimere atmospheric chemistry model.

#### eScience Center
The eScience Center is the national hub for the development and application of domain overarching software and methods for the scientific community. The eScience Center develops crucial bridges between increasingly complex modern e-infrastructures and the growing demands and ambitions of scientists from across all disciplines. The application of digitally enhanced scientific practices, referred to as eScience, is a fundamental toolbox for all researchers. In support of this goal the eScience Center funds and participates in multidisciplinary projects, with academia and industry, with optimized data-handling, efficient computing and big-data analytics at their core.

The eScience Center is a joint initiative of the Dutch national research council (NWO) and the Dutch organisation for ICT in education and research (SURF). The eScience Center uses OpenDA as part of the eWaterCycle project and is an active contributor to OpenDA.
