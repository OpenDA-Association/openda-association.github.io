This section has its own role to play in the OpenDA community. Presenting the parties that are now involved in OpenDA helps interested parties to find the services and support they need. If you are considering the use of OpenDA but would like to have support from experienced users, you can contact one of the parties mentioned below and see if they can help you out. An overview of the partners is given here. Please note that this section is intended as a service only; the OpenDA association does not accept liability for the services that are provided by a partner. Nevertheless, a consistently bad performance is likely to lead to discussions and consequent steps in the OpenDA association to which every partner belongs.
 
	
#### [Delft University of Technology, Applied Mathematics Department](https://www.tudelft.nl/ewi/over-de-faculteit/afdelingen/applied-mathematics/mathematical-physics)

Mathematical physics is concerned with the mathematical modeling of physical phenomena. Most often this leads to a mathematical model in terms of (partial) differential equations. In fact, differential equations present the main theme in our group and we employ both analytical and numerical solution methods. Simulations using computer implementations of models with practical significance have a large impact on our research. A close collaboration exists with external partners, such as Shell, TNO, and Rijkswaterstaat. A rather unique feature of our group is that we often consider large-scale systems together with large-scale computer models and that we address the specific mathematical questions arising from this. We mention data assimilation (coupling of model and measurements), flexible numerical methods (numerics for real-life applications), high-performance computing (enlargement of scale), multiple scale analysis and asymptotics (model simplification), and stochastic differential equations (dealing with uncertainties).
The Mathematical Physics Department was one of the originators of OpenDA and was home to the development of the computational core. Research into new data-assimilation methods and practical applications of data assimilation is done based on the OpenDA framework.  
**OpenDA services:** Fundamental and contract research in the field of data assimilation. 
 
#### [Deltares](https://www.deltares.nl/en)
Deltares is a Dutch independent research institute for water, soil and subsurface issues. We work on innovative solutions that make life in deltas, coastal areas and river basins safe, clean and sustainable. We conduct research and provide specialist advisory services for government authorities and the corporate sector in The Netherlands and globally. The essence of our work is the development, application and sharing of knowledge. We develop knowledge in partnerships with universities, other knowledge institutions and the business sector, not only in government research programs but also in contract research. Deltares has more than 850 employees, and we are based in Delft and Utrecht. Deltares has rich experience in applying OpenDA for water management models, including calibration of wave models and Kalman filtering for operational storm surge models. Deltares is one of the originators of OpenDA.  
**OpenDA services:** OpenDA projects in the field of water, soil and subsurface management.  
 
#### [VORtech](https://www.vortech.nl)
VORtech is a combination of a software house and an engineering firm in applied mathematics. We combine a thorough knowledge of mathematical modeling, simulation techniques and computational algorithms with state-of-the-art software development methods. VORtech specializes in high-performance computing, data assimilation and model coupling. VORtech has been actively involved in the development of OpenDA and has done several major projects involving the application of OpenDA. Among these was the IMPOSE project (together with BMT-ARGOSS and KNMI), in which we have developed a system to monitor the air quality over the North Sea, using satellite observations in combination with the Chimere atmospheric chemistry model.  
**OpenDA services:** OpenDA courses, helpdesk, OpenDA development, consultancy  

#### [eScience Center](https://www.esciencecenter.nl/)
The Netherlands eScience Center is the national hub for the development and application of domain overarching software and methods for the scientific community. The eScience Center develops crucial bridges between increasingly complex modern e-infrastructures and the growing demands and ambitions of scientists from across all disciplines. The application of digitally enhanced scientific practices, referred to as eScience, is a fundamental toolbox for all researchers. In support of this goal the eScience Center funds and participates in multidisciplinary projects, with academia and industry, with optimized data handling, efficient computing and big-data analytics at their core.

The Netherlands eScience Center is a joint initiative of the Dutch national research council (NWO) and the Dutch organization for ICT in education and research (SURF). The eScience Center uses OpenDA as part of the eWaterCycle project and is an active contributor to OpenDA.  
**OpenDA services:** Scientific projects using OpenDA, OpenDA development.
