# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  OpenDA is an open interface standard for (and free implementation of) a set of tools to quickly implement data-assimilation
  and calibration for arbitrary numerical models. OpenDA wants to stimulate the use of data-assimilation and calibration
  by lowering the implementation costs and enhancing the exchange of software among researchers and end-users.
